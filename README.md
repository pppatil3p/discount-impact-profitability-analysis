# Discount Profitability Analysis

##  Project Overview
This project analyzes the impact of discounts on business profitability using sales data.
The objective is to understand how different discount levels affect revenue and profit,
and to identify optimal discount strategies that maximize profit rather than just sales volume.

This project demonstrates data analysis, visualization, and business insight generation
using Python and data analytics tools.

##  Analysis Steps

### 1. Data Loading & Understanding
- Loaded dataset using Pandas
- Reviewed structure, data types, and summary statistics

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values (if any)
- Checked and verified duplicate records
- Ensured correct data types for numerical analysis

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Distribution of discounts
- Profit vs Discount analysis
- Sales vs Discount trends
- Category-wise and region-wise profit analysis

### 4. Visualization
- Scatter plots for Discount vs Profit
- Box plots to analyze profit distribution across discount levels
- Bar charts for category-wise profitability
- Trend analysis to identify loss-making discount ranges

##  Key Insights
- Higher discounts do not always lead to higher profits.
- Excessive discounts often result in negative profit margins.
- Certain product categories are more sensitive to discounts than others.
- Moderate or low discount ranges tend to balance sales volume and profitability better.
- Profitability varies significantly across regions when discounts are applied.

---

##  Business Recommendations
- Avoid high discount slabs that consistently lead to losses.
- Apply category-specific discount strategies instead of uniform discounts.
- Focus on optimizing profit rather than maximizing sales volume.
